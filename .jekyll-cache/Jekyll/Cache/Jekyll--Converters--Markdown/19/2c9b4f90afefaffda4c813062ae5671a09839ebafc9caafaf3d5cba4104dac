<p>It has been a few weeks since my first commit on the .io github repo for this site and it has been a really interesting learning experience which I would highly recommend… assuming that you already have quite a good grasp of HTML.</p>

<h3 id="github-pages">Github Pages</h3>
<p>I can’t remember exactly what it was that brought <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart">GitHub</a> Pages to my attention. I did not know that this was a feature offered and considering how powerful this is I am amazed it is completely free!</p>

<p>The only requirement for standard Git Hub users is that your repo for the site that you build has to be public, you can just enable Git Hub pages in the repo settings and with the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart">quick start guide</a> you can get a basic blog or site spun up in a few min.</p>

<p>For a standard site you could write everything on GitHub online and you can choose from some of the standard themes available on github.

<p>This is pretty amazing as a start. The default URL will be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[username].github.io/[reponame]</code> which is useful if you want multiple sites from multiple repos but what about if you want a landing page that is just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[username].github.io</code>? Well that is pretty simple - if you call your repo <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[username].github.io</code> this sets the pages url to be just your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[username].github.io</code></p>
