<p>Getting started with Power BI Report Builder and want to add a Shape File? If you are looking to use ONS files they will error without following this fix!</p>

<h1 id="the-error">The Error</h1>

<br /><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Length of the field of type N is 24. No spatial data available. The map display contains sample spatial data.</code></p>

<p>I have been using Power BI Report builder for about a week now and have got to the point where I wanted to start playing with maps. So I download a shapefile from the ONS geoportal, select to use a ESRI Shapefile in Power BI Report builder and get this error.</p>

<p>Looking online it looks to be a problem for both Power BI Report Builder and SSRS (which is not surprising given they are basically the same thing). In <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/0978141c-1a90-48b3-b1b0-6bcf4c7d5d87/error-loading-shapefiles-in-ssrs-maps?forum=sqlreportingservices">this post</a> someone identifies the issue which is with the format of some of the fields which SSRS canâ€™t handle. There is a tool for editing the .dbf file associated with the shapefile but this 1) requires you to download a tool just for this and 2) is not freeware so I wanted to find another fix.</p>

<h1 id="the-fix">The fix</h1>
<p><a href="https://mapshaper.org/">Mapshaper</a> to the rescue! This tool really is amazing, I have used it for conversion and shape-editing in the past so though I would try editing the shape attributes. First test was to remove all of the attributes except for just the ones I needed and that worked great but after a bit of testing I have found that you can retain all of the attribute data and get a working export as long as you filter and then export (just exporting without the edit step does not work).</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>I am using the <a href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons::nuts-level-1-january-2018-generalised-clipped-boundaries-in-the-united-kingdom/explore?location=54.484119%2C-3.250000%2C6.74">NUTS Level 1</a> shape file from ONS Geoportal in this example.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download Shapefile Zip from the <a href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/">ONS Geoportal</a></li>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://mapshaper.org/">https://mapshaper.org/</a></li>
  <li>Import Zip File

  <li>Open Console
<br /><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/2022-07-28-Console.png" alt="image-center" /></li>
  <li>Use the info command to identify the field names in the Attribute data section of the result
<br /><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/2022-07-28-Console_Info.png" alt="image-center" /></li>
  <li>Use the filter-fields command listing all of the field names (or just the ones you want to keep) - <strong>the format is important, there should not be any spaces between the column names</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter-fields [field1],[field2],[field3],[ect.]</code>
<br /><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/2022-07-28-Console_Filter-Fields.png" alt="image-center" /></li>
  <li>Export as Shapefile Zip then extract the zip</li>
  <li>In Power BI Report Builder open the map wizard or add a new layer to an existing map and select ESRI shapefile and load the .shp file from the folder that was just unzipped</li>
  <li>The shape map should now work and instead of the error you will see a preview of your map

    <h1 id="final-note">Final Note</h1>
    <p>I donâ€™t know why this works. I assume that the filter-field command must change the field format of the .dbf file that gets generated but I am not really bothered about why it works just that it does. I assume this fix will work if you get this error in SSRS but given that Power BI report builder is virtually identical I am going to assume that it will work for both.</p>
