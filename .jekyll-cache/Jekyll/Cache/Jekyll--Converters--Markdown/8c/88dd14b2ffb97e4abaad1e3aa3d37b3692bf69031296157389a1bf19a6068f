<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>A few weeks ago I started a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM">Bullet Journal</a> and got hooked instantly. The only problem I had was that if I am using a website, video or other digital tool how do I include it in the journal?</p>

<p>There are a number of options that I could think of but each one had pretty major drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write the URL<br /><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I am not writing out URLs and then Typing them again if I need them in the future</code></li>
  <li>Use a URL Shortener<br /><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Still have to type a URL in the future it is just shorter, and I have to hope that the service remains active or create my own URL shortener and support that long term</code></li>
  <li>Use Bookmarks in Browser and reference them<br /><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">This may work for some people but I am not a bookmark person, and I use multiple devices and browsers which are not all synchronized</code></li>
  <li>Use a digital notetaking app and cross reference both ways<br /><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Again could work for some people but I don't want to have to use another app on multiple devices and to have to open it and find the right reference when trying to find things in the future.</code></li>
  <li>Bookmarking Apps<br /><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Similar to the above two issues plus a whole other app just for bookmarks</code></li>
</ol>
