<p>So I have used this tool a few times over the years but have never really grasped its capabilities. The basic use is pretty straight forward and there is quite a bit of documentation on how to create some of the more basic charts which I will list below but after some deeper investigation there are a few more advanced examples that I have been able to adapt.</p>

<p>In terms of guidance there are a number of guide videos on You Tube which go creating fill charts using shapes and some of the more standard use for instance these ones from Curbal: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwOIIuRg-EI">#37 Easily create infographics in Power BI with infographic designer</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3671_O2iOu0">#D52 Easy and fast infographics in Power BI ðŸ“ˆ</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2016/07/InfoNice-Quick-Start.pdf">official quick start guide</a> is a really good and goes into a good level of detail on the capabilities of the tool. The videos and gallery on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/infonice/">original research site</a> give a great overview of capabilities and I will embed a few of the most interesting below.</p>

This is an quick example that I have created using the line chart option and overlaying a custom shape which I then bound to the Month which is the X-Axis of my chart. This allows you to customise the shape used and in the case of the above I have manually set these to represent weather to present seasonality but this could be useful for things like identifying the start of a global pandemic or lockdowns (to pull random hypothetical scenarios from the air).</p>
