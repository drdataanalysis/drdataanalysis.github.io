<p>Experiments with spaCy are going well in the appropriately named Jupyter notebooks.</p>

<p>There are two spaCy Natural Language Processing (NLP) components I am working with 1) Position of Speech (POS) and 2) Named Entity Recognition</p>

<p>This tutorial was really helpful in generalising the experiments I have been doing and looking at different aspects and capabilities of NLP.</p>

<p>The idea with this is to get a general set of tools developed in a notebook before looking at adapting the code to be used in Power BI to run NLP as a step in Power Query.</p>

<p>The big question is if you can load the NLP language library into Python running in Power BI (if not it is going to be tricky).</p>
<h3 id="starting-point">Starting Point</h3>
<p>So I am starting from an example here where NLP tools have been used to get an overview count of the contents of a csv of text values - which is great - but not what I need for a Power BI report to be able to explore the context of the results further so the following is simplified to just return the results of the NLP steps per result.</p>

<p>With the following I am assuming that you know the basics of installing modules and have done some introductory Python stuff all of which is very widely available online.</p>

<p>The files and code is all available on <a href="https://github.com/drdataanalysis/blog_python-text-analysis">GitHub</a></p>
