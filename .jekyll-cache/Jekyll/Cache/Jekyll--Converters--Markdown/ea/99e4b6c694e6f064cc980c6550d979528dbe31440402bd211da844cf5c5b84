<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>A few weeks ago I started a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM">Bullet Journal</a> and got hooked instantly. The only problem I found was if I need to make notes about a website or video how do I reference it in my physical bullet journal?</p>

<p>There are a number of options that I could think of but each one had pretty major drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write the URL<br /><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I am not writing out URLs and then Typing them again if I need them in the future</code></li>
  <li>Use a URL Shortener<br /><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Still have to type a URL in the future it is just shorter, and I have to hope that the service remains active or create my own URL shortener and support that long term</code></li>
  <li>Use Bookmarks in Browser and reference them<br /><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">This may work for some people but I am not a bookmark person because I don't want to have to organise them</code></li>
  <li>Use a digital notetaking app and cross reference both ways<br /><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Again could work for some people but I don't want to have to use another app and have to open it each time I want to access a link.</code></li>
  <li>Bookmarking Apps<br /><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Similar to the above two issues plus it's a whole other app just for bookmarks</code></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-i-wanted-to-be-able-to-do">What I wanted to be able to do</h3>
<p><strong>Process</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Save URL using my phone</li>
  <li>Add a sticker to my notebook with a QR code</li>
  <li>Scan the QR Code to get the link that has been saved
<br /><br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">So how do I do that?</code>
