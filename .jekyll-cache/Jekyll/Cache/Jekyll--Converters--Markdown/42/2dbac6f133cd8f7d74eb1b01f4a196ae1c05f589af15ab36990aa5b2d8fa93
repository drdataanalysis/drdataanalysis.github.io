<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>A few weeks ago I started a (Bullet Journal)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM] and got hooked instantly. The only problem I had was that if I am using a website, video or other digital tool how do I include it in the journal?</p>

<p>There are a number of options that I could think of but each one had pretty major drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write the URL <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I am not writing out URLs and then Typing them again if I need them in the future</code></li>
  <li>Use a URL Shortener <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Still have to type a URL in the future it is just shorter, and I have to hope that the service remains active or create my own URL shortener and support that long term</code></li>
</ol>
