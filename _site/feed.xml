  &lt;p&gt;This post is about why I quit Data Analysis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-comfort-zone&quot;&gt;My Comfort Zone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of my career has been dedicated to leading a team of data analysts. I have been fortunate enough to work towards a meaningful cause and have had the flexibility to engage in various other tasks as needed, such as systems development or training. For the longest time, Data Analysis was my primary focus and data engineering supported me and my team in conducting analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-changed&quot;&gt;What Changed?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, Microsoft announced that within a year, they would discontinue a tool that connected our system to our Azure SQL Database. This tool had facilitated a significant shift in our work process and helped us to create an array of reports. To their credit, Microsoft provided a 12-month notice and presented us with two options: use a data lake or use a data lake with Synapse. I pulled together an options paper based on all the available info and flagged the risk and recommendations to the business within a couple of weeks of the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crunch-point&quot;&gt;Crunch Point&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without delving into the details, time passed and the 12 months became 6, then 3, and finally 1. Although the options paper was approved early on, the necessary resources for implementation were not readily available. As a result, the implementation became a last-minute endeavor. With only one month remaining, my proposal to use Synapse was put into action. Two weeks later, it was set up and handed over to me. Thus, I had two weeks to implement a Data Lake solution that would facilitate our core operational reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-response&quot;&gt;My Response&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing Synapse turned out to be a wise decision. Microsoft had recommended configuring a Data Lake joined with Synapse, which included storage and data factory. Setting up the Synapse link was straightforward, but then the question arose: how do we get the data to the reports?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Learn proved to be invaluable during this time. I cannot stress enough how important it was to have access to this resource. I had to quickly familiarize myself with and implement a whole new way of working with data, including concepts like Data Lake House, Serverless SQL, and Data Factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I considered switching all reporting to Serverless SQL via the Data Lake, as the tools had changed but the data schema and structure had not. However, I soon realized that this was not feasible given the time constraints. So, my solution was to push new and changed data from the Data Lake into the old SQL database on a nightly basis using Data Factory within Synapse. This ensured that no changes were required for the existing reports, except that any changes made during the current day would not be included (which was not a significant issue for the majority of reporting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With just a couple of days left until the deprecation, I was able to turn off the old link at midnight one evening. From that point onwards, data factory started inserting new records and updating existing ones through a scheduled pipeline run using a data flow that I built. It is worth mentioning that this data flow was dynamic from day one, running for each entity on a loop with passed parameters. Interestingly, I take particular pride in adding an if statement that skips entities without any new or altered records. This was achieved by examining the metadata of files in the data lake folder, resulting in a few minutes of processing time saved each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short term - Pyspark and Notebooks to connect tricky APIs and integrate existing pipelines which were using Power Automate. I was able to complete another very short notice data challenge for another part of the organisation and ensure reporting continuity. I got to grips with the power of Delta Tables and started to explore the architecture and structure that a Delta Lake House could facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, I used Pyspark and Notebooks to connect with complex APIs and integrate existing pipelines that were using Power Automate. I completed another data challenge for another department on very short notice, ensuring continuity in reporting. I also started exploring the power of Delta Tables and the architecture and structure that a Delta Lake House can facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium term - I took the risk to go fully into engineering and architecture in a new role (quitting data analysis) and was successful and this is now the day job and obsession: to enable Data Analysis, Insight and Science to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium term, I took a risk during a restructure to apply to move into an engineering and architecture role, leaving behind data analysis. I was successful and the new role has now become my day job and passion: enabling Data Analysis, Insight, and Science to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead in the long term, I have numerous data consolidation projects and exciting projects for both myself and the team. I am eager to expand our use of Synapse and prepare for the introduction of Fabric, which is likely to transform data in a similar way that SharePoint changed file management and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is how I made the decision to quit data analysis. The past year has presented significant challenges but also incredible opportunities for growth. Along the way, I have discovered new tricks and tips that I intend to share through this blog. For now, the title will remain the same, as Data Analysis (and Science) is what the engineering and architecture work enables.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dean Robinson</name></author><category term="News" /><category term="Data Engineering" /><category term="Data Architecture" /><category term="Synapse" /><summary type="html">This post is about why I quit Data Analysis</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fix ONS Maps for Power BI</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/ONS-PowerBI-Change/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fix ONS Maps for Power BI" /><published>2023-12-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/ONS-PowerBI-Change</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/ONS-PowerBI-Change/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-has-changed&quot;&gt;What has changed?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that the map files generated by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;ONS&lt;/a&gt; have been modified and no longer function correctly in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mapshaper.org/&quot;&gt;MapShaper&lt;/a&gt; without a tweak. &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Desktop/Problem-using-custom-shape-map/m-p/3334798/highlight/true#M1112738&quot;&gt;This comment&lt;/a&gt; on a community post provides all the necessary information to identify and resolve the issue, although it does not explain how to do this in MapShaper. This is all the additional information I will provide here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change that has been made is related to the map’s projection. The default projection for files published by the ONS is now EPSG:27700, which is an Ordnance Survey spatial reference mapping created in 1936. While it is excellent for advanced mapping of the UK using sophisticated tools, it is not compatible with a simple mapping tool like Power BI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the comment, in the case of the ONS, you simply need to load your file (GeoJSON, Shape, etc.) into MapShaper, open the console, and paste the following command (including the minus symbol), then press enter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;-proj from=EPSG:27700 crs=EPSG:4326
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see what changes you can type “info” and enter before running the above and you will see the following in the listed details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CRS:      +proj=tmerc +x_0=400000 +y_0=-100000 +lon_0=-2 +k_0=0.9996012717 +lat_0=49 +datum=OSGB36
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you run the command above if you type info and enter you will see that the CRS section has changed to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CRS:      +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also notice that the map has slightly changed shape (it will appear wider), but this will look fine in Power BI and serves as a visual demonstration. You can then make further adjustments to your map and, when ready, export it as TopoJSON, which is compatible with Power BI.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dean Robinson</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="Power BI" /><category term="Advanced Visual" /><category term="Geomaping" /><category term="ONS" /><summary type="html">How to convert ONS map files to be compatible with Power BI</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fix Issue with Shapefile Maps</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/Shapefile-Map-Report-Builder/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fix Issue with Shapefile Maps" /><published>2022-07-28T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-07-28T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/Shapefile-Map-Report-Builder</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/Shapefile-Map-Report-Builder/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shapefile up or ship out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started with Power BI Report Builder and want to add a Shape File? If you are looking to use ONS files they will error without following this fix!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-error&quot;&gt;The Error&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2022-07-28-Error.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2022-07-28-Error.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Length of the field of type N is 24. No spatial data available. The map display contains sample spatial data.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using Power BI Report builder for about a week now and have got to the point where I wanted to start playing with maps. So I download a shapefile from the ONS geoportal, select to use a ESRI Shapefile in Power BI Report builder and get this error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking online it looks to be a problem for both Power BI Report Builder and SSRS (which is not surprising given they are basically the same thing). In &lt;a href=&quot;https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/0978141c-1a90-48b3-b1b0-6bcf4c7d5d87/error-loading-shapefiles-in-ssrs-maps?forum=sqlreportingservices&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; someone identifies the issue which is with the format of some of the fields which SSRS can’t handle. There is a tool for editing the .dbf file associated with the shapefile but this 1) requires you to download a tool just for this and 2) is not freeware so I wanted to find another fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-fix&quot;&gt;The fix&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mapshaper.org/&quot;&gt;Mapshaper&lt;/a&gt; to the rescue! This tool really is amazing, I have used it for conversion and shape-editing in the past so though I would try editing the shape attributes. First test was to remove all of the attributes except for just the ones I needed and that worked great but after a bit of testing I have found that you can retain all of the attribute data and get a working export as long as you filter and then export (just exporting without the edit step does not work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons::nuts-level-1-january-2018-generalised-clipped-boundaries-in-the-united-kingdom/explore?location=54.484119%2C-3.250000%2C6.74&quot;&gt;NUTS Level 1&lt;/a&gt; shape file from ONS Geoportal in this example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download Shapefile Zip from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;ONS Geoportal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mapshaper.org/&quot;&gt;https://mapshaper.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Import Zip File
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2022-07-28-Import.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2022-07-28-Import.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open Console
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2022-07-28-Console.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2022-07-28-Console.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the info command to identify the field names in the Attribute data section of the result
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2022-07-28-Console_Info.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2022-07-28-Console_Info.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the filter-fields command listing all of the field names (or just the ones you want to keep) - &lt;strong&gt;the format is important, there should not be any spaces between the column names&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;filter-fields [field1],[field2],[field3],[ect.]&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2022-07-28-Console_Filter-Fields.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2022-07-28-Console_Filter-Fields.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Export as Shapefile Zip then extract the zip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Power BI Report Builder open the map wizard or add a new layer to an existing map and select ESRI shapefile and load the .shp file from the folder that was just unzipped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The shape map should now work and instead of the error you will see a preview of your map
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2022-07-28-Working.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2022-07-28-Working.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;h1 id=&quot;final-note&quot;&gt;Final Note&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know why this works. I assume that the filter-field command must change the field format of the .dbf file that gets generated but I am not really bothered about why it works just that it does. I assume this fix will work if you get this error in SSRS but given that Power BI report builder is virtually identical I am going to assume that it will work for both.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;My obsession with QR codes has gone to another extreme&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM&quot;&gt;Bullet Journal&lt;/a&gt; and got hooked instantly. The only problem I found was if I need to make notes about a website or video how do I reference it in my physical bullet journal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of options that I could think of but each one had pretty major drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write the URL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;I am not writing out URLs and then Typing them again if I need them in the future&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a URL Shortener&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Still have to type a URL in the future it is just shorter, and I have to hope that the service remains active or create my own URL shortener and support that long term&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Bookmarks in Browser and reference them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This may work for some people but I am not a bookmark person because I don&apos;t want to have to organise them&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a digital notetaking app and cross reference both ways&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Again could work for some people but I don&apos;t want to have to use another app and have to open it each time I want to access a link.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bookmarking Apps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Similar to the above two issues plus it&apos;s a whole other app just for bookmarks&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-wanted-to-be-able-to-do&quot;&gt;What I wanted to be able to do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideal Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save URL using my phone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add a sticker to my notebook with a QR code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scan the QR Code to get the link that has been saved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;So how do I do that?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-idea&quot;&gt;The idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a while trying to think of technical options and ways to build something to do this then finally had the idea to start with the beggining of the process - saving a link on my phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On android there are many share options but it was “GitHub - Create Issue” that stood out. Clicking on that puts the URL into the body of an issue and auto populates the name of the issue with the link title. Best of all GitHub issues all have the same URL format &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://github.com/[UserName]/[RepoName]/issues/[IssueNumber]&lt;/code&gt; and the issue number just goes up by 1 with each new issue created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The rest of the process was pretty easy to sort out - I need to create QR codes which is easy in Python and I need to create stickers which is easy using mail merge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-did&quot;&gt;What I did&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created a private repo called “journal-links” but it could be public or called anything you want for this to work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setup a Excel file to be used in python and the mail merge with a row for each of the QR codes that need to be generated with formulas for the URls:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/2022-02-24-ExcelFile.webp&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generate the QR codes using python to create a PNG for each of the links:
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/cde5e33b3110feb109e897beeefec976.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a mail merge with the generated qr codes as images in stickers (I just googled how to do this)
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;How it works&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I have label sheets with 16 stickers per sheet and can set the Issue Number to where I am up to (1-16,17-32 etc.), run the Python QR code to generate the new numbers, open the mail merge and print.&lt;nr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When I want to create a citation I can select to share on my phone and create a issue in the journal-links repo or create one manually from GitHub online from my PC then add the next sticker to my bullet journal and add a description to the label. This has the added benefit of being able to add multiple links to a issue if there are several things I want to include in the citation and the links can be edited at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;be&gt;
To view the cited links I can use google lens search to read the qr code which then opens the issue in the GitHub app and it is one click to open each link.&lt;/be&gt;&lt;/nr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This may be a very niche need which is why I struggled to find a solution I liked but I am very happy with the solution I have created. It is worth noting that for my needs I created the first two sheets (32 stickers) and am still only half way through the first one. If high volumes are expected - i.e. your a full time student it may be necessary to tweak the process to be able to more easily generate larger numbers of stickers at once.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;5 Years since it was released and I am only now realising quite how amazing this is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used this tool a few times over the years but have never really grasped its capabilities. Making basic charts is pretty straight forward and there is quite a bit of documentation available. After some investigation there are a few more advanced examples that I have been able to adapt which I have included below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of guidance there are a number of guide videos on You Tube which go creating fill charts using shapes and some of the more standard use for instance these ones from Curbal: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwOIIuRg-EI&quot;&gt;#37 Easily create infographics in Power BI with infographic designer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3671_O2iOu0&quot;&gt;#D52 Easy and fast infographics in Power BI 📈&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2016/07/InfoNice-Quick-Start.pdf&quot;&gt;official quick start guide&lt;/a&gt; is a really good and goes into a good level of detail on the capabilities of the tool. The videos and gallery on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/infonice/&quot;&gt;original research site&lt;/a&gt; give a great overview of capabilities and I will embed a few of the most interesting below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-of-my-ideas&quot;&gt;Some of My Ideas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used some of the above examples in reports to replace things like gauges with something more engaging and relevant to the measure being used. The one extra tip I would give from using these practically is to open the visual in full screen when you want to use the edit pane. This makes it a lot easier to make design changes as the edit pane will only be as big as the size of the visual on the screen so it can be quite difficult to see even if your chart is quite big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;custom-icon-line-chart&quot;&gt;Custom Icon Line Chart&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/2021-11-24-LineChart.webp&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; /&gt;
This is an quick example that I have created using the line chart option and overlaying a custom shape which I then bound to the Month which is the X-Axis of my chart. This allows you to customise the shape used and in the case of the above I have manually set these to represent weather to present seasonality but this could be useful for things like identifying the start of a global pandemic or lockdowns (to pull random hypothetical scenarios from the air).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;category-picture-charts&quot;&gt;Category Picture Charts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/2021-11-24-BarChart.webp&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; /&gt;
This example is really quite basic and adapted from some of the above. I think I have seen something similar in other custom visuals but this is quite a simple way of adding custom text, icon or image labels to a column chart (or bar chart).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this has been helpful and given some ideas for the kinds of things that you can do with the infographic designer custom visual. The visual is defiantly not the most polished or dynamic custom visual available but I think it has some really powerful functionality and allows a degree of customization that is very cool.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dean Robinson</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="Power BI" /><category term="Infographic Designer" /><category term="Advanced Visual" /><summary type="html">Resources and experience of using the Infographic Designer custom visual in Power BI</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Creating my New Blog!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/news/My-New-Blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Creating my New Blog!" /><published>2021-11-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-11-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/news/My-New-Blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/news/My-New-Blog/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a few weeks since my first commit on the .io github repo for this site and it has been a really interesting learning experience which I would highly recommend… assuming that you already have quite a good grasp of HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;github-pages&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t remember exactly what it was that brought &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; Pages to my attention. I did not know that this was a feature offered and considering how powerful this is I am amazed it is completely free!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only requirement for standard Git Hub users is that your repo for the site that you build has to be public, you can just enable Git Hub pages in the repo settings and with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart&quot;&gt;quick start guide&lt;/a&gt; you can get a basic blog or site spun up in a few min.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a standard site you could write everything on GitHub online and you can choose from some of the standard themes available on github.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/pages/select-theme.png&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is pretty amazing as a start. The default URL will be &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[username].github.io/[reponame]&lt;/code&gt; which is useful if you want multiple sites from multiple repos but what about if you want a landing page that is just &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[username].github.io&lt;/code&gt;? Well that is pretty simple - if you call your repo &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[username].github.io&lt;/code&gt; this sets the pages url to be just your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[username].github.io&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jekyll--ruby--vs-code&quot;&gt;Jekyll &amp;amp; Ruby &amp;amp; VS Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the out of the box pages functionality is great I wanted something more. Pages can still support other Jekyll themes and functionality that is published to your pages repo but you need to do that from your PC. In my case I am using VS code and GIT to connect to the repo from my Ubuntu laptop and installed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/#install-dependencies&quot;&gt;Ruby and Jekyll dependencies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting the final site I had a go at creating a clean install based on the following this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&amp;amp;list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB&quot;&gt;youtube guide&lt;/a&gt; to learn the fundamentals of Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had the basics I started to look at options in terms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme&quot;&gt;themes&lt;/a&gt;. One that looks really good was &lt;a href=&quot;https://raviriley.github.io/agency-jekyll-theme-starter/&quot;&gt;the agency theme&lt;/a&gt; which I really like the look of but because I wanted to do a combined Portfolio and Blog I needed a theme that worked for both of those uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;minimal-mistakes&quot;&gt;Minimal Mistakes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/&quot;&gt;Minimal Mistakes&lt;/a&gt; is a really popular theme that includes a lot of page styles and theme options. The documentation is also very good and it was very easy to get started and customise fom the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes&quot;&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/assets/images/dark-skin-post.png&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;customisation&quot;&gt;Customisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did end up messing around in the templates to customise the theme a little and going quite deep into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/&quot;&gt;configuration&lt;/a&gt;. I should probably have done that in a forked repo that I could customise but instead I brought the code into the site repo to edit which means that it is a bit of a mess… but then I am still trying to figure stuff out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great thing about minimal mistakes is that it is very popular so there is quite a bit of guidance available in issues etc. One example is finding &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/490&quot;&gt;this issue&lt;/a&gt; explaining how I could edit the header to make it fixed at the top of each page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;take-aways&quot;&gt;Take Aways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have really enjoyed learning to use Jekyll and building the site so far. It defiantly takes work and effort to get to grips with but the results are pretty immediate and rewarding. Knowing some core HTML will definitely be helpful to getting into customisation and more advanced functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course one of the key positives is that GitHub pages are completely free as is the theme and functionality I am using which is amazing!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dean Robinson</name></author><category term="News" /><category term="Jekyll" /><category term="Ruby" /><category term="GitHub" /><summary type="html">Update on my new blog and portfolio using Jekyll and GitHub</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Shape Maps in Power BI</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/Shape-Maps/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Shape Maps in Power BI" /><published>2021-03-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-03-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/Shape-Maps</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/Shape-Maps/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thought it was about time to get in shape&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a bit of a tangent but wanted to share useful links as this is something that I have pulled together with multiple sources and not something that I could find a joined view of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maps are tricky. Getting your data in the right format, right place and most difficult correct shape is really difficult. One approach is to focus only on getting your data in the right place by using latitude and longitude to plot data in the correct places but shape maps are definitely the best way to present data about geographies such as Countries, Regions, Local Authorities, Postcode Areas etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the box there are a few shape maps like US states, UK countries but for my purposes I need shape maps for Local Authorities, Postcode Areas, Regions and other geographic distributions inside the UK. Custom maps can be loaded and as &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/desktop-shape-map#use-custom-maps&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You can use custom maps with Shape Map as long as they are in the TopoJSON format. If your map is in another format, you can use online tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://mapshaper.org/&quot;&gt;Map Shaper&lt;/a&gt; to convert your shapefiles or your GeoJSON maps into the TopoJSON format.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Power Maps (plugin for excel) this is achieved through Shape or KML files but in here we need TopoJSON. On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;ONS Geoportal&lt;/a&gt; you need to go to the APIs rather than downloads for the GeoJSON link for whichever boundary you are wanting. Going to the URL and saving the JSON file locally you can then load it into &lt;a href=&quot;https://mapshaper.org/&quot;&gt;Map Shaper&lt;/a&gt; and export as TopoJSON in the top right hand corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that gives you any boundary published by the ONS as a format that can be loaded into Power BI, from a bit of testing the associated shape data can be matched according to any of the parameters so for Local Authority that is the JSON file ID, Local Authority Code or Local Authority name which is pretty helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that is all great until you rightealise that the latest boundary map (at time of writing) is the 2019 Local Authority list and the latest local authority list is 2020 which includes the merging of Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, South Bucks and Wycombe into Buckinghamshire Local Authority and my data is aligned to the 2020 list. I was able to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.flourish.studio/article/187-how-to-merge-regions-with-mapshaper&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; to merge together the old local authority boundaries and adapt this one to create field names for the new shape then re-join the maps and…

So a bit of a tangent but useful set of tools to be able to use shape maps for the geographies that I need and something that can be built on in the future if I need to do something like creating custom region maps that are not available from the ONS.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dean Robinson</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="Power BI" /><category term="Advanced Visual" /><category term="Geomaping" /><category term="ONS" /><summary type="html">How to use ONS Local Authority shape maps in Power BI and how to create custom maps based of existing.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">VADER and Power BI</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/VADER-and-PowerBI/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="VADER and Power BI" /><published>2021-03-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-03-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/VADER-and-PowerBI</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/VADER-and-PowerBI/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Search your feelings. you know it to be true”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment&quot;&gt;VADER&lt;/a&gt;) is the main alternative to TextBlob and is designed to work with social media text primarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again this has been a really simple adaptation of the code used so far in all of the text analytics tools we have applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment#about-the-scoring&quot;&gt;outputs&lt;/a&gt; of VADER are a little different to TextBlob and does not include scoring for subjectivity but does break down into 4 aspects the Compound Score which is the key sentiment scale but also individual scores for pos: positive, neu: neural and neg:negative that are ratios of the proportion of the text analysed so you can drill into a bit more context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparison with TextBlob
So the sample data I have been using in my template is thousands of tweets so it is no surprise that for that data VADER seems to have an advantage over TextBlob:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/2021-03-03-Comparison.webp&quot; alt=&quot;image-center&quot; /&gt;
On other data I have tested on TextBlob has the advantage when comparing against a satisfaction score within the data but this is also very different to social media forms of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other key consideration is that this is the out of the box use of both tools with stop words and further customisation it is likely that a great deal more accuracy can be gained for both tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dean Robinson</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="Python" /><category term="Natural Language Processing" /><category term="Power BI" /><category term="VADER" /><category term="pandas" /><summary type="html">How to use VADER in Python to analyse sentiment in PowerBI</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">TextBlob and Power BI</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/TextBlob-and-PowerBI/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="TextBlob and Power BI" /><published>2021-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/TextBlob-and-PowerBI</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/TextBlob-and-PowerBI/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TextBlob makes me polarity:1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding text capabilities with Sentiment in Power BI is one of the key things I have always wanted to be able to do. The code for this is pretty much the same as covered previously and as with all of the tools I have covered so far this is the most basic application of each tool - there is a lot more that can  be done with further customisation based on the types of data you are working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/&quot;&gt;TextBlob&lt;/a&gt; is a Natural Language Processing tool (NLP) to identify the sentiment (polarity) of a text string on a scale of -1 (negative) to 1 (positive). As well as sentiment you can export a subjectivity score on a scale of 0 (objective) to 1 (subjective) which can be a really useful way of exploring your and the correlation between sentiment and subjectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
