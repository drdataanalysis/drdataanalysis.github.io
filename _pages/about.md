###### Experience

## This post has a custom sidebar set in the postâ€™s YAML Front Matter.

An example of how that YAML could look is:

###### Interests
## My Interests and Hobbies  
<iframe style=" width: 100%; height: 50vh;  overflow: hidden;" scrolling="no" src="/assets/images/key-interests.svg"></iframe>
<object data="/assets/images/key-interests.svg"></object>
<i class="far fa-fw fa-hand-spock" aria-hidden="true"></i> 
I am a big Science Fiction fan in particular things like Star Trek and the Expanse.
