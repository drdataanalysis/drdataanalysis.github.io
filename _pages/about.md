> I want to make it easy for everyone to use data for good.

`That is why I created this blog - to share tools, techniques and resources I develop or utilize that help make advanced data tools easier to use.`

# Skills and Experience

I have worked with data for nearly 15 years, worked for a major UK charity since 2012 and have managed data and systems teams since 2015.

You can find full details of my roles and the organisations I have worked for on [![Linkedin Profile](https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-%230077B5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drdataanalysis)
