> In this project I have adapted core Python text analytics tools to extract key information and sentiment within the Power BI data import processes.<br>The aim was to develop generalized versions of the code that can easily be adapted for a variety of text sources. <br>Using Power BI to extract, Python to transform, then Power BI to load and present the data means that any data analyst can use powerful data science tools.
