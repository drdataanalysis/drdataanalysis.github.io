> In this project I am developing a Delta Lakehouse Model within Azure Synapse Analytics to support the warehousing and utilization of a vast array and amount of data. While not currently using Fabric the tools and techniques I am developing are all compatible and preparatory for utilizing Fabric in the future once the product and infrastructure have matured a little.
