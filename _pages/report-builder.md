> In this project I have presented examples of customizable visual tools and how to adapt them to fit your needs. <br>In one example I have brought together guides and tools to create custom shape maps adapted from the ones produced by the office of national statistics(ONS).<br>Another example brings together guides for the Ideographic Designer custom visual and looks at a few custom ideas that I have produced using the tool.
